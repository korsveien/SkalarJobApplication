# Funkbit Job Application

This is the job application I used to get a part time job as a software developer at Funkbit.
It includes a HTML5 game (highscore is level 11) and some information about myself.

## How to use

Checkout and open index.html in a modern browser like Google Chrome.

## Code naming convention

All publically accessible as well as local variables and functions are camelCased. Inaccessible/private functions and
variables are _underscore_seperated. Trust me, it made sense at the time.

## Other

The job application should be self explanitory, just read the information contained in index.html
