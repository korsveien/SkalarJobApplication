    <h3>Applying for part-time position as software developer</h3>

    <p>I was one of the participants on your company presentation at UiO (University of Oslo) one month ago, and wish
        to apply for the job of part-time software developer with this application (presented as a web page).</p>

    <p>This site is created to show my proficiancy in HTML/CSS/Javascript, and as such this site does not rely on any
        third party framework like JQuery, and it also includes a simple but highly addictive game. Everything on this site
        is programmed by yours truly. This site requires a modern browser with support for HTML5 technologies, like Safari
        or Chrome.</p>

    <p>As the site was designed to run locally, I have avoided the use of AJAX requests, as not all browsers allow AJAX
        requests to local files. This is the reason why all html content is confined to one file -- index.html -- instead
        of being spread across multiple files.</p>

    <p>The next pages include a better description of my skills, and of course the HTML5 game, as well as contact
        information.</p>

    <h3>Clean Code</h3>

    <p>I try to follow the guidelines of Robert C. Martin's book "Clean Code" whenever possible. Functions are small and
        contain descriptive names, resulting in code that is easy to read and understand, without the necessary use of
        comments which -- acording to the book -- is a sign of the software developers inability to express him/her-self in
        code. Naturally I can write comments, and do so in projects where this is part of the convention. For solo-projects
        like this however, I like to avoid comments at all costs, so that it is really important that the code itself is
        readable.</p>

    <p>In this project I also make full use of the potential of the javascript language. Instead of the general way to
        create "classes" in Javascript, I follow the module pattern, where class-constructors are functions that return
        objects. This allows me to hide functionality (private variables and functions), and also increases the speed of
        function calls (with the drawback of increased memory-usage). Following the module pattern, I also never have to
        use 'this', which has it's own little quirks, or remember to use the 'new' keyword when creating instances.</p>

    <p>Web-applications often utilizes third party frameworks like JQuery. In this project I have decisively avoided
        such frameworks to better prove my understanding of the javascript language. All code in this project is namespaced
        under the 'fja' object to avoid name-collisions with eventual future code.</p>

    <p>All javascript code in this project is available under the 'Scripts' folder.</p>

<div id="mobile" class="pageContent">
    <h4>Mobil Utvikling</h4>

    <p>I've developed an app called Episode Next for iOS, Android and Symbian devices, so I have some experience with
        mobile development. I've developed native apps, as well as web-based mobile apps using phonegap.</p>

    <p>The game in this project can be used in combination with phonegap to make the game available on mobile devices.</p>

    <p><i>Originally, this application included an android version of the game, created with phonegap.</i></p>

    <h3>Jet Challenge</h3>

    <p>The goal in this game is to avoid the incoming missiles for as long as possible.
        Control your airplane with your mouse, clicking on the place you wish it to fly.</p>

    <p>Good luck!</p>
